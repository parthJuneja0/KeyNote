Here are some additional tips for deploying React apps to production:

Use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve your app's static assets. This can improve the performance of your app by serving assets from servers that are closer to your users.
Use a reverse proxy to serve your app's dynamic content. This can help to protect your app from malicious attacks.
Configure your app to serve the correct HTTP headers. This can improve the performance and security of your app.

After logging in the user will be provided with a auth token - Here, we use JWT authentication

JWT token consist of three parts 
1. Header - include algorithm and token type
2. payload - data of the user
3. signature - token will be signed with a SECRET

This secret could be saved in .env.local file or.cfg file , meaning it will not be exposed 

This will help to verify if payload data is changed !!!

jwt.verify() method can be used to check if someone has tempered the token !!!
